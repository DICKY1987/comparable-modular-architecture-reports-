### Python — code quality & tests

* **Ruff MCP (lint/format/fix)** — fast linting/formatting; great as a default. ([LobeHub][1])
* **Analyzer (Ruff + Vulture)** — wraps Ruff (style/errors) and Vulture (dead code) in one server. ([GitHub][2])
* **Python LFT (Lint/Format/Test)** — one server that runs lint, format, and tests; convenient for greenfield repos. ([LobeHub][3])
* **Pylint MCP** — Pylint via MCP; good for rule-by-rule guidance. ([Medium][4])
* **Pytest runners** — run tests from the AI with structured results (useful for TDD loops). ([GitHub][5])
* **PyPI package intel** — query versions/deps/metadata to guide import choices. ([GitHub][6])

### Cross-language — code context & repo ops

* **GitMCP** — turns any GitHub repo into an MCP knowledge hub (kills “hallucinating unknown APIs”). ([GitHub][7])
* **Sourcegraph codesearch MCP** — precise multi-repo code search/snippets for examples and references. ([GitHub][8])
* **Git operations MCP** — read/search/manipulate repos (commits, branches, grep). ([PyPI][9])

* **PowerShell MCP (general)** — fuller cmdlet discovery, run scripts, list modules. ([GitHub][11])

* **Microsoft AI Shell & PowerShell Universal** — host/plug MCP in PS environments (handy if you’re PS-first). ([Microsoft Learn][13])
